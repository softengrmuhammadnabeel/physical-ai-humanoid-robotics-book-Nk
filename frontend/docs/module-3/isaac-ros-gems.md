# Isaac ROS Gems

## High-Performance Robotics Building Blocks

## Introduction

**Isaac ROS Gems** are a collection of **GPU-accelerated, production-quality ROS 2 packages** developed by NVIDIA to accelerate robotics development. They provide optimized perception, navigation, and AI processing pipelines that run efficiently on **NVIDIA GPUs and Jetson platforms**.

Isaac ROS Gems act as **ready-to-use brain components** for robots, enabling real-time performance that traditional CPU-based ROS nodes often cannot achieve.

## What Are Isaac ROS Gems?

Isaac ROS Gems are modular software components that:

* Integrate directly with **ROS 2**
* Leverage **CUDA and NVIDIA acceleration**
* Provide deterministic, low-latency performance
* Are designed for **real-world deployment**, not just simulation

They form a bridge between **AI algorithms and robotic hardware**.

## Role in the AI-Robot Brain

In the AI-robot stack, Isaac ROS Gems handle:

* **Perception** (vision, depth, LiDAR)
* **Localization and mapping**
* **Sensor processing and fusion**
* **High-speed data pipelines**

They allow the robot’s brain to **process sensory data faster, more accurately, and more reliably**.
