# Natural Language → Actions

## Introduction

**Natural Language → Actions** refers to the ability of robots to **interpret human language commands and translate them into executable actions**. This is a key component of the **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** framework, enabling intuitive human-robot interaction.

Robots equipped with this capability can perform tasks in response to **spoken or written instructions**, leveraging AI models for language understanding, perception, and planning.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* Parses input text or speech transcription
* Extracts intent and actionable information
* Handles ambiguity and context using AI models

### 2. Semantic Mapping

* Maps words and phrases to specific **robotic tasks or skills**
* Associates objects, locations, and actions with environment perception
* Supports hierarchical and multi-step tasks

### 3. Action Planning

* Converts interpreted commands into sequences of actions
* Integrates with motion planning, manipulation, or navigation modules
* Incorporates constraints such as safety, reachability, and robot kinematics

### 4. Feedback and Adaptation

* Monitors execution success and environmental changes
* Adjusts actions dynamically if conditions change
* Provides human-readable feedback for task completion or errors

## Workflow

1. **Input Capture:** Receive spoken or written command
2. **Transcription (if speech):** Convert audio to text using models like Whisper
3. **Language Understanding:** Parse text and extract intent
4. **Task Mapping:** Map intent to robotic actions
5. **Action Planning:** Generate executable plans and trajectories
6. **Execution:** Perform actions and monitor outcomes
7. **Feedback:** Update plan or provide status to user
